# Boids in Blazor

This is an implementation of the boids simulation, using Blazor WASM. It's hosted through GitHub Pages on https://cyberchris.xyz/BlazorBoids/.

It's inspired by [swharden's article](https://swharden.com/blog/2021-01-08-blazor-boids/#the-c-boids-model) except I try to maximize
the amount of code in C# instead of JS, to see how performant it is.
